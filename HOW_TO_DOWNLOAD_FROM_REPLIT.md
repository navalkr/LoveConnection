## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **Missing files?** Make sure you're using the file explorer to verify all files were extracted properly
- **Large files?** GitHub has a file size limit of 100MB; larger files need Git LFS
- **Permissions issues?** Make sure you have write access to the directory where you're working

Remember to copy your environment variables securely and avoid pushing sensitive API keys to GitHub.
